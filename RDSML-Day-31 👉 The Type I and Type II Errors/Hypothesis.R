#Type 1 error explanation
#Type 1 error occurs when we reject a true null hypothesis. This means that we conclude there is an effect or difference when, in fact, there is none. For example, if a medical test indicates that a patient has a disease when they do not, this is a Type 1 error.

#Type 2 error explanation
#Type 2 error occurs when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis. This means that we conclude there is no effect or difference when, in fact, there is one. For example, if a medical test indicates that a patient does not have a disease when they actually do, this is a Type 2 error.

#Null Hypothesis explanation
#The null hypothesis is a statement that there is no effect or no difference. It is the default assumption that any observed effect in the data is due to chance. In hypothesis testing, we aim to either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on the evidence provided by the data.

#Four conclusion regarding null hypothesis
#1. Reject the null hypothesis: This means that the evidence suggests there is a significant effect or difference.
#2. Fail to reject the null hypothesis: This means that the evidence does not suggest a significant effect or difference.
#3. Accept the null hypothesis: This is not a formal conclusion in hypothesis testing, as we can never prove the null hypothesis true; we can only fail to reject it
#4. Accept the alternative hypothesis: This means that the evidence suggests there is a significant effect or difference, leading us to favor the alternative hypothesis over the null.
